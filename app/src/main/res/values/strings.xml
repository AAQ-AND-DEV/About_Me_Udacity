    <string name="bio"><b>You see my name above. That\'s mine, but you can use it.</b>\n\nI\'ve been coding for several years, but have mostly made very simple apps. Hopefully, that will soon change, as I progress through this Udacity Android Kotlin Nanodegree!\n\nI\'m committed to making the world a better place for people, animals, and plants. <b>All life is my concern</b>, basically.\n\nWhen one spends as much time in front of the computer as I do, one starts to wonder whether I\'m contributing too much to energy consumption.\n\nI\'ve read that the very complex <b>AI</b> being developed, in naive ways, actually consumes a huge amount of energy, <i>which is a drag, because <b>AI</b> can be a helpful resource.</i>\n\n</string>
